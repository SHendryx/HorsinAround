# Project Bojack

## Getting started

### Clone the repository

Move to the directory where you want the project to be stored.

Then run:

```
git clone https://gitlab.ecs.csus.edu/horsin-around/project-bojack.git Project-Bojack
```

_Note: The final argument will be the name of the directory you clone into. Feel free to change it._

## Setting up your identity

You will need to make your commits using your ECS email:

```
git config user.name "First Last"
git config user.email ecs_username@ecs.csus.edu
```
